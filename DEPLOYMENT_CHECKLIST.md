# VoiceVerse Backend Deployment Checklist ‚úÖ

## Pre-Deployment Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Server optimized for production
- [x] Environment-specific configurations added
- [x] Health check endpoints implemented
- [x] CORS configured for production
- [x] Code pushed to GitHub
- [x] Database (Supabase) already configured

## Render Deployment Steps

### 1. Create Render Web Service
- [ ] Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
- [ ] Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
- [ ] Connect your GitHub repository: `eugene12345678/VoiceVerse`
- [ ] Configure service settings:
  ```
  Name: voiceverse-backend
  Environment: Node
  Region: Oregon (US West) or closest to your users
  Branch: main
  Root Directory: server
  Build Command: npm install && npx prisma generate
  Start Command: npm start
  ```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Copy these from your local `server/.env` file to Render:

**Required Variables:**
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] `PORT=10000`
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` (your Supabase connection string)
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` (generate a new secure one for production)
- [ ] `JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d`
- [ ] `EMAIL_FROM` (your email)
- [ ] `EMAIL_PASS` (your email app password)
- [ ] `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (your Stripe key)
- [ ] `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (your Stripe webhook secret)
- [ ] `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (your ElevenLabs key)
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` (your OpenAI key)
- [ ] `FRONTEND_URL=https://voice-verse-two.vercel.app`
- [ ] All Firebase configuration variables

### 3. Deploy and Test
- [ ] Click "Create Web Service"
- [ ] Wait for build to complete (3-5 minutes)
- [ ] Check deployment logs for errors
- [ ] Test endpoints:
  - [ ] `GET /` - API status
  - [ ] `GET /health` - Health check
  - [ ] `GET /api/health` - Detailed health

### 4. Update Frontend
- [ ] Update frontend `VITE_API_URL` to your Render URL
- [ ] Test frontend connection to new backend
- [ ] Verify all features work correctly

### 5. Production Considerations
- [ ] Generate new JWT_SECRET for production
- [ ] Switch to live Stripe keys (if ready for production)
- [ ] Set up file storage (Cloudinary/S3) for uploads
- [ ] Enable auto-deploy in Render
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts

## Your Render URL
Once deployed, your API will be available at:
```
https://voiceverse-backend.onrender.com
```

## Important Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è **File Storage**: Render uses ephemeral storage. Uploaded files will be lost on restart. Consider migrating to:
- Cloudinary (recommended for audio/images)
- AWS S3
- Supabase Storage

üîí **Security**: 
- Use strong, unique JWT secrets
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Monitor API usage and quotas

üìä **Monitoring**:
- Check Render logs regularly
- Monitor performance metrics
- Set up health check alerts

## Troubleshooting
- **Build fails**: Check package.json dependencies
- **Database errors**: Verify DATABASE_URL format
- **CORS issues**: Ensure FRONTEND_URL is correct
- **API errors**: Check environment variables

Your VoiceVerse backend is ready for production deployment! üöÄ
